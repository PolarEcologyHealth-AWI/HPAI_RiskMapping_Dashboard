<h3>Introduction</h3>
Since the turn of the century high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, have increasingly emerged along with the increase in global poultry production. This causes a major burden to the poultry industry, and more recently also wild birds, livestock and humans. The goose/guandong lineage HPAI H5N1 emerged in 1996 and has been circulating and evolving further for decades, current descendants of the virus belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b causing a global panzootic. Assisted by the movement of migratory birds, the virus has spread near-worldwide with the exception of Australia and New Zealand, and has had unprecedented impacts on wild animal populations as well as devastating impacts on the poultry industry. <span style="font-weight:900">Understanding the potential role of wild birds in introducing and spreading HPAI in Australia is an important aspect of preparedness and response planning for human health and industry, as well as for wildlife managers</span>. Wildlife Health Australia has therefore compiled a High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) clade 2.3.4.4b incursion risk assessment for Australia (<a href="https://wildlifehealthaustralia.com.au/Portals/0/ResourceCentre/BiosecurityMgmt/HPAI_incursion_risk_assessment_Australia.pdf" style="color:#6065d3">link</a>). Yet, the risk of a HPAI incursion to Australia, and next of its establishment and spread, is fluid. It varies depending on where and when and with what intensity HPAI is present in countries overseas and whether migratory birds can next bring the virus from there to Australia. And if an HPAI incursion into Australia occurs, whether it becomes established and results in a further spread depends on where and when it arrives, and whether HPAI susceptible species  are likely to present at that location and in large numbers. To provide insights in these highly dynamic processes and data sets of global HPAI outbreaks, bird migrations, species at risk and susceptible bird aggregations on our continent, we here bring these together in a platform that will be updated whenever major developments in this space takes place, so that stakeholders have all relevant information at hand in one place.
