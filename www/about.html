<h3>Cautionary note:</h3>

<h4>
<p>Given the urgent need for information relevant to the development of an appropriate response to the potential incursion of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) into Australia, we have chosen to here release any relevant information that our project generates as soon as it becomes available. However, this means that the information provided in this document (inclusive of data provided in hyper links) is tentative only and is provided under embargo (until publication of the official report, which is scheduled for 31 January 2025). Any use of the data provided should first be verified with marcel.klaassen@deakin.edu.au.</p>
